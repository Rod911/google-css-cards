Harris is not totally convinced that this would hit the stumps. He has a chat with Labuschagne at the non-striker's end and goes for the review at the last second. Ultra Edge comes in and shows no edge on that. Ball Tracker comes in now, pitching outside off, impact in line and wickets CLIPPING!

It is just touching the top of middle and leg poles and thus it is Umpire's call. Australia in a spot of bother now.</span>

The review is retained but Australia lose their second wicket in the form of Marcus Harris. This was pitched on a length around the fourth stump line by Broad, he gets it to angle into the southpaw. Harris looks to come on the front foot and defend it but misses the ball to get hit high on the pad. The English players appeal and the umpire raises his finger after thinking for a long time. Harris is not totally convinced that this would hit the stumps. He has a chat with Labuschagne at the non-striker's end and goes for the review at the last second. Ultra Edge comes in and shows no edge on that. Ball Tracker comes in now, pitching outside off, impact in line and wickets CLIPPING! It is just touching the top of middle and leg poles and thus it is Umpire's call. Australia in a spot of bother now.</span>

It is just touching the top of middle and leg poles and thus it is Umpire's call. Australia in a spot of bother now.</span>

                        <span>That ends the fourth Test coverage at Old Trafford. It is Australia who are 2-1 up. Ashes is theirs, will the series be as well?

                            STEVEN SMITH HAS BEEN NAMED THE MAN OF THE MATCH (Is anyone surprised?) 10 days ago, he was sitting in the dressing room, watching the agony of his side not being able to clinch a win. But here, come Old Trafford, a new dawn has been set.

                            Ohhh... with the Ashes over (even though the series is not over yet), the interviews keep coming, don't they? Josh Hazlewood trots up now. Hazlewood says it is a fantastic feeling and feels all the bowlers bowled really well. Further adds Cummins is a huge engine and Lyon was good too. States you need to be ready when the skipper calls you on and feels Marnus Labuschagne too contributed with an important wicket of Jack Leach. Tells he is still feeling pretty good now but might be a little sore tomorrow. Mentions another great Test match was visible. Informs his heart was definitely beating fast towards the end but he is pleased they got over the line. Ends by saying they would still be eager to win the series here and would go all out in the last game.

                            Marnus Labuschagne now comes up for a chat. Labuschagne says it means a lot to bring the urn back to Australia. States it is one of the best series he has played and it is even better since it is won in England. Further adds Test cricket was at its best as wickets came quickly but England's lower order played really well. Says the Brits will always come hard which was visible here. On him being given the ball by Paine and then getting the breakthrough, Marnus states he wanted to trust himself with the ball. Cheekily says that he dragged the previous ball before the wicket one down but then kept telling himself to believe in himself. Adds he is lost for words at the moment. Ends by saying it was a privilege to play for Australia, the opportunity that came to him, wasn't how he expected it to but he is delighted he did well then.

                            Time for some interviews. Steven Smith first up. Smith says it feels amazing that the Ashes is coming home now. Further adds he has come here a few times but things never went their way. States winning the Ashes here is one thing which he wanted to tick off his bucket list. Informs the boys were getting a little bit tired out there towards the end. Tells England fought really hard especially Overton, who was really good but fortunately the boys got the job done. Says he feels absolutely delighted with how he has performed in this series especially after what he has gone through.

                                    91.3: J Hazlewood to Overton, OUT! LBW! Three reds and Overton is a goner! Marvelous scenes out there as AUSTRALIA HAVE RETAINED THE ASHES! Overton's fighting innings comes to an end. It is Josh Hazlewood who gets the last wicket. A good nut. It lands on off and jags back in. Overton looks to defend but misses to get hit on the front pad. A huge appeal. It looked a touch high but up goes the finger. Overton has no choice but to review. He signals the 'T'. Time for the replays. Ultra Edge shows no bat. Time for the Ball Tracker and it shows the ball to be hitting the leg pole. Australia continue to celebrate. THEY WIN BY 185 RUNS AND LEAD THE SERIES 2-1!

                            10:44 pm Is that the game? Overton has been adjudged LBW. He has taken the review immediately. Hit on the knee roll. Is it a bit too high? Nothing on the Ultra Edge as the ball goes past the bat. Three reds on Ball Tracker. THE ASHES STAY WITH AUSTRALIA!

                            91.2: J Hazlewood to Overton, A short one and on the body, Overton looks to duck again but the ball hits him on the body. That must have hurt but you need to brush it off and continue.

                            10:42 pm Bowling change, again! Just one over for Marnus Labuschagne to break the stand. Hazlewood is on now. His numbers so far, 17-5-31-1.
